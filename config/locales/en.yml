    title: Manifesto for Responsible Software Development
    headline:
      row1: "In order to foster a free and fair society I affirm that I will practice my profession with responsibly and with dignity."
      row2: "I will abide by the following principles:"
    content:
      sub1:   I am ethically responsible for my decisions and I will act according to my conscience.
      text1:  The impact of software is growing continuously in all areas of our lives. I acknowledge the
              consequences to humanity and the environment that evolve from our work.
      sub2:   I will not develop of software that is intended to violate human rights and civil liberties.
      text2a: It is increasingly possible to violate personal and human rights with the use of software as the
              boundaries between real and digital world become blurred.
      text2b: I know that I can't control software once it is released so I have a responsibility to consider the
              potential for my software to violate peopleâ€™s right before I start to implement it. I will reject
              projects which facilitate this abuse.

      sub3:   I will be worthy of the faith in me as an expert of my profession.
      text3a: The possible negative consequences of the improper use of complex software are
              inconceivable to most users. Therefore it is our responsibility as software developers to
              communicate the boundaries of proper use clearly.
      text3b: When I realize that a software that I released is not applicable anymore, my minimum
              responsibility is to let potential and existing users know.
      sub4:   I will collect only the data that is essential for my task. I will store it only as long as needed.
      text4:  My applications are likely to collect personal information. I will safeguard this, and use it only
              as the provider of the information intended. I will treat their data as if it were my own.
      sub5:   I will do my very best to prevent the waste of energy and resources.
      text5:  The increasing number of devices that contain software has a strong impact on the global use
              of resources and energy.
    footer:   I make these promises solemnly, freely and upon my honor.
